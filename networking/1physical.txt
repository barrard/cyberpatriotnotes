Conclusion

Data -> Segment -> Packet -> Frame -> Bits


Comunication
requires
	-a medium : like air for sound waves to travel through
	-a language: and a set of rules: protocol
	-protocol for how to behave and interact


-Physical layer
	-real life connections
	-voltages, radio frequancy
	-primarily describes how a single device interacts with a meduim
-Major functions
	-establish and terminate connections
	-resource sharing(conection resolution and flow control)
	-modulation converting digital to a physical 
-wifi ethernet card, network hubs, all physical

-Network Hub
	-connects multiple netowrked devices together
-network adapter
	-connects a device to a network
-Modem
	-MOdulates and DEModulates as ADC

-NETWORK topology - define architecture of network
	-star - each device connected to a central node(hub or switch) provides isolation, easy to scale, however all eggs in one basket
	-Ring - data travels in one direction through each node, no central node, still one break will break the entire thing
	-Bus - one shared bus for everyone to conect to, only one device can talk at once, degrades as more devices are added
