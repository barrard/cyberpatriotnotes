Data link layer

-building upon the physical layer
-can check errors in physicla layer, broken wires
-only traveres a single network(ei, not routed)
(routing is layer 3, with IP)
-just layer 2 use MAC address, unique 6 byte ID hard coded om netowrk card
	-00:11:22:33:44:55 //6 bytes - hexidecimal
	-first 3 bytes are the OUI - unique nabyfactuer
	-can be spoofed
-data travels in frames 
	-each frame has a source and destination MAC address
--Common devices at this level
	-switches
		-keep track of each device is on which port
			-CAM - content addressable memory tabel
			-if full, it will boradcast out to all devices, getting message out is ultimate goal for switch
		-a hub would just forward all packets(layer 1)
			-layer 1
			-no inteligence
			-just repeats communication
	-bridges
	-wireless access point
ARP - Layer 3, but assists with layer 2
	-Adress Resolution Protocol
	-links IP address to MAC address
	-FFFFFFFF broadcast, all 1's
	-device responds, hey this is me
	-stored in Cache
-ARP probe
	-device confirimg an assigned IP is unique
-Gratuitous ARP
	-Device declairing its IP
	-not asked for
	-target for offensive atack
linux and windows command
	-arp
	-arp -a
	-replaced by the command IP neighbor
-01-00-5e - broadcast mac address
