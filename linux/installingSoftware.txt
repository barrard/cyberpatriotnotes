Most packages can come from the distrubution CD, depending on the distro, DVD, vs CD, vs Live

software comes in 2 forms
-Packages premade, precompiled
-Source, so compile ourselves

-Compile steps
	-./configure
	-make
	-sudo make install

-configure - makes a make file for the OS environment
-make - uses makeFile to compile software
-make install - copies the appropriate software to right dir and requires root

# ./configure && make && make install
	-&& - condition, if true, then run this

-To remove software
	-make uninstall
	-will not always work

Most linux distros use package managers to make install more succesful less error prone
	-red hat uses RPM
	-Debian uses APT
	-pre compiled for the distro and processor
	-GUI or CLI

Examples
# rmp -Uvh NewApplication-3.2.1.rpm //-U measn upgrade or install, -v verbose, -h shows progress bar

-possible rpm -Uvh http://site.example.com/Aplication-1.2.3.rpm

-to delete, use -e
# rpm -e NewApplication

-Options to check for tampered files

# rpm -Va | sort //-V verify, -a all packages

Linux distro maintain repositories of all software included
- enables us to get all out software from one place
-Red Hat systems this tool is called "yum"

EXAMPLE:
# nmap // command not found
# rpm -qa | grep nmap //-qa will list all packages installed in our environment, to verify if its there or not

$ yum search nmap // results in a list of packages available

$ sudo yum install nmap

$ sudo yum erase nmap 

Software updating, important for security

# yum update

-to update a specific package
# yum update tcpdump

-or update all but specific package
# yum update --exclude tcpdump


$ sudo yum update  // DO IT FOR SECURITY
