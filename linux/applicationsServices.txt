services are called daemons (DEE-mons)

applications are started by the user like a webrowser, text editor

daemons(services) are started by the OS and run in the backgroud

-typical linux boot process
	-BIOS starts he boot loader
	-boot loader loads kernel into memory
	- the kernel mounts disks/partitions and starts init daemon
	-init daemon starts services based on the runlevel
A runlevel defines a set of services to run on startup
	-runlevels are esentially profiles

6 runlevel typically
	-1 is single user mode, for diagnostic
	-most usually run at 3 or 5

0: system Halt(shutdown)
1: single user mode, no GUI(no services)repair, reset root pass
2: milti-user mode, no GUI or networking
3: multi-user mode, no GUI, have netowrk
4: not defined by default, user definable
5: multi-user, load GUI, normal user mode
6: reboot

-Each service is started by an init script to manage starting and stopping gracefully

/etc/rc.d/ - contains dirs that corespond to each runlevel

each runlevel dir (/etc/rc.d/rcN.d) contains symlinks to init scripts
	-this enables one script thats used by mulltiple runlevels
	-numbering according to start order for dependencies
	-each symlink starts with S(start) or K(kill)
-Its important to shutdown services which are not used to limit accesibility to attackers

Managing these folders with
	-chkconfig
-to check all or specific
#chkconfig --list [service name]

-to enable or disable
# chkconfig <service name> <on|off>

-or at specific runlevel
# chkconfig --level 5 <sevice name> <on|off>

sorta GUI is "ntsysv"
	-semi-graphical
	-encurses?

Service-config-services
	-full on GUI to manage services
-to instal 
$ sudo yum -y install system-config-services

System > Adminsitration > services
start service or
enable service to start on reboot

$ su -
# service sshd status

# chkconfig sshd off

ls -hal /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/*sshd

Offensive target
	-init Backdoor

-creating a backdoor in /etc/rc.d/init.d
